There is an opportunity to reduce the response time at the Load Balancer end. Currently, the Load Balancer reads through FAB_Master.txt file for every request and creates a multi-dimensional array (holding items like url, port, max-users etc against the FAB Id).\n\nBased on single user test on my machine I am observing that this process consumes almost 90% of the total time taken by the Load Balancer. I am proposing that since the file does not change often, we should not read and build the array for every request. The array should be re-built only if the file changes. Based on tests on my machine, I think this will cut the over-all response time by more than 80%.\nCan we have this approach reviewed by the development team?

1. There are a lot of adhoc requests which are not getting tracked. We strongly recommend that for any adhoc request on running these batches, it should documented and published so that there is an accountability on execution of each batch job and its impact on the system as a whole.\n\n2. It is also recommended that for batches which takes higher time for processing, there is a clear case for converting them into real time service. In case of jobs running in a batch, it is observed that the job will wait in the process queue, until the batch is triggered. This means that the job will be waiting idle until it qualifies to be executed in the particular batch. This in result will lead to jobs getting delayed in the entire workflow. If these batches are converted into real time service, the job will be executed then and there and will be made available to the next process queue. This will benefit in total turn around time of the jobs.

It is recommended that the batch execution frequency is reduced from 30 mins to 10 mins. Next workflow task for scrutiny will be available 20 mins faster than the current scenario.

reversemis batch processing logic
Improvement to exisitng logic of processing Reverse File Gen Corp:\nCurrently, when an Excel file triggers an OOM error the status of the file remains unchanged and hence when App server restarts it picks the same file and that too crashes due to OOM error. This loop continues and blocks other good files from being processed. This flow/logic can be chnaged to add one more status to the files. Currently, each reverse MIS file has only 2 statuses, Unprocessed and Porcessing Finished. Adding third status of "Processing Started" should help alleviate above loop problem. At the outset, file status would be "Unprocessed". Flow should first pick up unprocessed files for processing. Very first thing to be done is to change its status as "Processing Started". Once entire processing for the file is finished, update the status to "Processing Finished" (This is current logic. No change is needed.). When there is an error like OOM etc, the file status will remain "Processing Started" and hence this errorneous file will not be picked during subsequent runs. Once all files with status "Unprocessed" are completed, flow can loop through files with status "Processing Started". With this change, erroneous files won't block other good files from being processed thus improving reliability of the application and will also add retry logic for erroneous files.

This boilerplate code can be elimindated by using Hibernate framework . Follwing would a typical workflow for converting the existing logic into hibernate . \n1) Each table will be mapped to an Java Entity (pojo) via annotations/HBM mapping files\n2) For retrieval or updating of entities , simple HQL queries can be written which will return an Entity Object populated with values or can directly update an Entity object in the database . \n3)Hibernate can make use of Multiple caches for improvement in performance \na) Session level cache - This cache is turned on by default and helps with caching in the same session\nb) 2nd level cache in hibernate by default implemented by Ehcache helps in bringing common cache to the table . Any set of entities that needs to be cached at the sessionfactory level can use 2nd level cache . Timeouts,Invalidation policies can be set accordingly . \nc) Query cache can be used locally for certain queries which are called repeatedly and are suppose to deliver consistantly simmilar results.\n4) Further hibernate can be guided to use connection pooling mechanism of Jboss by using the Hibernate config file . In case hibernate connection pooling is required it can used by setting properties for C3p0 connection pooling mechanism of hibernate. \n5) Be extra cautious while mapping relationships in entities. Decide which properties and relationships will load lazily and which will load eagerly

After analyzing thread dump, it has been observed that 52% of total thread was in blocked state. All these threads were blocked while getting connections from DB. The effect of getconnection() method is that a lot of threads gets blocked during processing of resultset object. Each of these processing  have a connection assigned to it which does not get released until the processing/transformation of resultset object into json gets completed. This incident has been observed on hslpaext1 - 10.60.5.175 for OPS application.\n\nCode review comment:\nIn code, connection is getting released after the result object gets converted into json. For json conversion Blob column is used which is taking time for transformation from/to json. This is done to save memory, but this will take time for processing resultset object. The optimization of code would not save a significate time in releasing DB connection.

"Application logic can be modified so that batch program loops back for\ \ more records and processes them instead of process getting killed after completion\ \ of data check. In case no records can be processed, it should go to sleep for\ \ a defined period of time and then start the processing again.  This would avoid\ \ excessive processing logic in the application. \\nThis also ensures that existing\ \ DB connections will be reused thus avoiding cost of creating and destroying new\ \ connections. So, 32 connections will be used instead of 2.4L in 30 mins. \\nThis\ \ will also ensure the process is continuous there by reducing the cost of creating\ \ new process and probably it also reduce the cost of ps \u2013fu being fired from\ \ shell scripts."

Possible Approaches :\n\n1. To eliminate such cases of having unwanted sessions on the database for a long time, we need to establish a threshold value which needs to be set, so that the session is timed out after the user is not doing anything on the system. \n\nThis needs to be set on resin.conf for the tag <session-config> with parameter as <session-timeout>\nEg :\n<session-config>\n        <session-timeout>10</session-timeout> -- This is set for 10 mins. Please confirm with the application team if this value is okay.\n\n2. The session parameter on the database is not correctly configured. The session value needs to be increased to 1.5 times the processes. Currently the processes value is 1200 and sessions value is 1325.  This will take care of high concurrency coming into the application. Please check on a periodic basis what is the concurrency achieved in GBM during peak load. Post this, the value should be estimated and setup.\n\n3. You can alternatively clean up all invalid sessions, by adding a timeout for the jdbc user by setting up a Idle_time value in the profile. This will ensure all the invalid sessions are terminated after the idle time threshold is reached.\n\nPlease find below the steps to do that :\n\n1. alter system set resource_limit = true;\n2. create profile idletime limit idle_time 30;  --- This should be established after concurrence with the product team.\n3. alter user system profile idletime;

web server
Append is called multiple times, logically invoke method is multiple times called in append function. The multiple invoke invocation can be avoided by passing the string of required object from the WCIG function.\nFor an example :\nAppend function\n\nvar oEcoClass = TheApplication().InvokeMethod("LookupValue","QNTS_WCIG_CABIN_CLASS","Economy");\n var oFirstClass = TheApplication().InvokeMethod("LookupValue","QNTS_WCIG_CABIN_CLASS","First");\n var oBClass = TheApplication().InvokeMethod("LookupValue","QNTS_WCIG_CABIN_CLASS","Business");\n var oPEClass = TheApplication().InvokeMethod("LookupValue","QNTS_WCIG_CABIN_CLASS","Premium Economy");\n\nInstead of the above\nvar oCmpClass = TheApplication().InvokeMethod("LookupValue","QNTS_WCIG_CABIN_CLASS",passingString);\nThe calling function WCIG\nwould have Append("Economy")\nAppend("First")\nThis reduces the multiple invocation firing in the append function. The WCIG called append method 4+4 = 8 times and in append method invocation is fired 4 times for each call. 4*8 = 32 times it is calling the invocation, which can be reduced to 8*1 = 8 times. We can save the execution cycle which helps us to improve the performance.

The primary database is possibly configured with a standby database. \nARCH wait on SENDREQ monitors the amount of time spent by all archiver processes to write the received redo to disk as well as open and close the remote archived redo logs, so optimization of the network needs to be done here, possibly in association with network administrators, and with network monitoring tools. After the network has been optimized the DBA team can perhaps see the results at the log and tracefile levels, or can modify appropriate parameters in Oracle configuration files, to further enhance the network.

'The common components of the SGA are: \n(a) Data buffer cache - cache data and index blocks for faster access. \n(b) Shared pool - cache parsed SQL and PL/SQL statements. \n(c) Dictionary Cache - information about data dictionary objects. \n(d) Redo Log Buffer - committed transactions that are not yet written to the redo log files. \n(e) Java pool - caching parsed Java programs. \n(f) Streams pool - cache Oracle Streams objects. \n(g) Large pool - used for backups, UGAs, etc. \n\nWhen automatic shared memory management is enabled, Oracle will adjust the memory parameters dynamically on the fly. \nTo see currently allocated sizes at runtime, one can query the appropriate views.\nIf automatic Shared Memory Management is enabled, the sizes of the different SGA components are flexible and can adapt to the needs of a workload without requiring any additional configuration. The database automatically distributes the available memory among the various components as required, allowing the system to maximize the use of all available SGA memory. Oracle Database remembers the sizes of the automatically tuned components across instance shutdowns if you are using a server parameter file (SPFILE). As a result, the system does need to learn the characteristics of the workload again each time an instance is started. It can begin with information from the past instance and continue evaluating workload where it left off at the last shutdown.\nAgain, the default granule size of the particular version of Oracle one is using, plays an\nimportant role in SGA sizing policies.\nAll SGA components allocate and deallocate space in units of granules. Granule size is determined by total SGA size. \nOn most platforms, if the total SGA size is equal to or less than 1 GB, then granule size is 4 MB. For SGAs larger than 1 GB, granule size is 16 MB. Some platform dependencies may arise. For example, on 32-bit Windows NT, the granule size is 8 MB for SGAs larger than 1 GB. One can consult the operating system specific documentation for more details, or query the V$SGAINFO view to see the granule size that is being used by an instance. The same granule size is used for all components in the SGA.\nIf you specify a size for an SGA component that is not a multiple of granule size, the Oracle database will round the specified size up to the nearest multiple. For example, if the granule size is 4 MB and you specify DB_CACHE_SIZE as 10 MB, the database actually allocates 12 MB.\nIt may be a better practice to leave default values for the less important components of the SGA\nlike java_pool_size,large pool_size or streams_pool_size, unless your applications are using them substantially.\nFor instance, an increased value of java_pool_size will be justified in case of heavy java activity on the database.'

a.            Increase freelists  of table & its indexes to 5 (no can be increased if event occurs again).

Table & corresponding indexes can be moved to larger block size tablespace of 16K. The inserts would become faster.

The root cause of the performance issue is that there are lot of transaction on the frozen accounts which are going into entered state. Infosys will internally explore this further. If the transactions are posted for these frozen accounts without the need of proxy posting, there is a huge time and effort saved on this batch program which will lead to reduction of total TAT of the EOD process.

While there are various workflow and BPM engines available, we recommend that the workflow be custom developed through a MVC framework given that the workflows are not very complex. The Applications in general follows a data view/ modify activities in a Maker-Checker mode and involves 2-3 steps in the workflow at the most. For such complexity levels, a custom workflow mechanism will be both easily maintainable as well as quick to implement (given that other workflows will have a learning curve).  \nHowever, a set of commonly used workflow engines has been provided. These may be useful in the future if there is a need for a comprehensive workflow engine to replace the custom workflow mechanism. All the options are fairly close in their feature list - specific call can be taken once requirements for the Workflow engine/ BPM is defined.

The RTGS bulk upload process which is run as a background process to be seperated from the 'laps' process script and executed in a seperate script with desired parallel processing
application
Another main reason for transaction going into ENTERED status is locking of records, i.e multiple process using the same records at the same time which results in resource busy error for process which are waiting for the record to be released. This can be overcome by an inbuilt parameter provided in FINACLE called INTV_LOCK_POST (env variable). This has to be configured in micro seconds. The default value if not configured is 500000 micro seconds which is 0.5 secs. If a process finds that the record it requires for processing is locked by another process, then the process will try to acquire the record 60 times(hard coded in the product) with 0.5 secs ( the parameter which is defined) time gap between each iteration. So totally a process will wait for 30 secs (60 x 0.5) to acquire a record and if it doesnt after 30 seconds the process will throw a resource busy error. This value can be configured to a higher value if a single transaction takes a long time in posting and the record is not available for other process. This parameter will affect the entire FINACLE application and hence care and proper testing needs to be done before applying this parameter. Better is to bifurecate RTGS to a seperate server if this parameter is going to be applied. We can check on the usage of this parameter, based on the response from Infosys on the call which will be raised for the above point

Detailed approach to solve the problem:\n1. Use of "FOR UPDATE" should be avoided in the code.  \n2. If it is required then test with adding 'WAIT 10'  for the 'FOR UPDATE'  statement, this will wait for 10 seconds for the lock on row to be released.\n This will eliminate to  wait indefinitely for a lock to be released.\n3. The new statement will be as below.\nSELECT PKID, PIID, CREATION_TIME, REASON,ENGINE_MESSAGE_S,ENGINE_MESSAGE_L,VERSION_ID FROM PSBPCDS.SAVED_ENGINE_MESSAGE_B_T WHERE (PKID=HEXTORAW(:1)) FOR UPDATE WAIT 10;

Since only file_rk is sent to the SOA, there is no reason for batching to be implemented. Get rid of batching logic and insert all rows in the file into OTC database and make only one call to SOA Member Addition service. This will reduce number of HTTP connections to be established with SOA server.
java
'Process rows inside a file in a multi-threaded manner. It is recommended to use Java''s Executor service to multi-thread file processing logic. Since most, if not all , of validation engine and data insertion logic is independent of rows within the file, this entire logic can, and should, be multi-threaded. Validate and insert all rows in  a file, using Java''s Executor service.\n\nBased on NMON logs shared with us, we do not see CPU pressure on any of the servers, and hence multi-threading OTC validation and data insertion flow should improve throughput of the end-to-end flow. (This is assuming SOA layer and GA already process data in a multi-threaded manner, which is most likely the case). \n\nTo start with, the Executor service''s max thread pool size can be set to 5. Based on CPU headroom analysis on all serevrs, this number can be increased further.\n\n(As pointed out in receommendation #15 above, since batching logic is unnecessary and inefficient in this flow, if that is gotten rid of first, the multi-threading of the file proecessing will be that much less cumbersome).'
